<h1>Story</h1>

<p>
I wrote this little "excercise book" initially only for myself. I usually learn new things by doing as much excercise as I can. Obviously you can find 
lots of excercises related to regex on the internet, even you can make same on your own, but finding  a complete collection of excercises builded some 
kind of logical order is not easy. That is why I created this.
</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>

<ul>
<li>I used Mastering Regular Expressions Third Edition by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl. The excercise book follows the order of the book</li>
<li>The book uses egrep. For the difference between grep, egrep and fgrep please follow this <a 
href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/17951">link</a></li>
<li>Because of deprecating egrep, I used grep -E everywhere, you should do that too</li>
<li>I used Linux (Arch Linux) for the excercises, I do not know PowerShell, they may or may not work on Windows</li>
<li>
Bash was my shell interpreter. I recommend you to make an alies for the earlier mentioned 'grep -E' command:
<ul>
<li>Put this to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc (w/o single quotes): 'alias egc="grep -E --color"' and issue either source ~/.bash_profile or source ~/.bashrc command (or you can log out and log in again)</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
