Regular expressions
===================

This repository contains simple exercises I made in order to learn regular expressions.

The book I used to learn is Mastering Regular Expressions written by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl. The repository organized by chapters as the book. I use Linux (Arch Linux in particular) with egrep (just as the book suggests). To use this exercise collection you need to be familiar with Linux command line (on Windows Cygwin could be useful), basic Linux commands and their usage as well.

The exercises use these external sources as input data:
